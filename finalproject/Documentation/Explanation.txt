Explantion of Project

1. Company A mints 10000 "Loyalty Tokens" (LT) to distribute to customers who purchase services as a reward.
2. Customers will get 1 LT for every 10 ADA spent
3. Once a user has accumulated 10 LT they can claim (mint) a "Gold Star" Loyalty NFT utilizing CIP 25 metadata that allows them special privledges with the company.


    The ability for a Company, in this case Company A, to track customer purchases on the blockchain is paramount. By implementing a system where purchases are recorded on the 
    Cardano blockchain, Company A can ensure the integrity and transparency of its loyalty rewards program. Through this blockchain-based solution, Company A can seamlessly mint 
    and distribute "Loyalty Tokens" (LT) to customers as a reward for their patronage, addressing step one of the project. The blockchain's ledger allows for accurate tracking 
    of customer purchases, ensuring that customers receive the appropriate number of LT based on their spending, as outlined in step two. Furthermore, with the accumulation of LT,
    customers can claim (mint) a "Gold Star" Loyalty NFT, which grants them special privileges with the company, as described in step three. This Cardano-based system not only 
    facilitates the distribution of rewards but also enables Company A to personalize customer experiences, analyze purchasing patterns, and enhance customer engagement. Overall,
    the integration of blockchain technology in tracking customer purchases empowers Company A to build trust, loyalty, and lasting relationships with its customers while driving 
    operational efficiency and innovation in its loyalty rewards program.
